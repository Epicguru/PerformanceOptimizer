# PerformanceOptimizer
This is a mod for RimWorld, which adds various performance tweaks to the game. Its goal is to boost your game performance to some degree if you already struggling with it. With this mod, you might expect about 20-35% of performance gains, but it hugely depends on your modlist and current TPS. If you already have TPS maxed to the current target (like 60 TPS at normal speed, 180 TPS at double speed), then this mod won't do much. This mod is compatible with Rocketman and Rim73 and is generally loaded bottom in mod order.

Current features:
1) UI elements will be hidden until you hover on them, which should save some FPS and TPS. Currently, resource readout, bottom button bar, right overlay buttons, speed buttons were made hidden. Alerts are minimized (only important and medium will be shown) until hovered. These features are enabled by default, if you don't like them, you can disable them in mod settings.
2) Faster GetComp replacements.
3) About 20+ vanilla methods are cached or throttled and some will be recalculated only in N refresh rates.
4) Possibility to disable sounds completely if you don't need them or you want to save some TPS. By default, it's off.
5) The mod comes with mod settings where you can configure everything in the mod.
