# PerformanceOptimizer
This is a WIP mod for RW, which adds some performance tweaks to the game.
Currently following tweaks are implemented:
1) GetComp replacements which points towards faster code, which should yield some TPS.
2) UI elements will be hidden until you hover on them, which should save some TPS.

If you encounter issues with this mod, don't forget to submit a bug report in the Issues section.
